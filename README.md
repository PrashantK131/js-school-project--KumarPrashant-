\- A timeline section displaying key technological events (e.g., ARPANET in 1969, first personal computer in 1977, IBM PC in 1981, and Microsoft Windows 1.0 in 1985).

\- Each timeline event includes a year, title, description, placeholder image, and a "Learn More" link.

\- An empty modal div for future pop-up functionality.

\- Basic CSS for layout, styling, and theme toggling.

\- A footer with a prompt to search the web for more information.
