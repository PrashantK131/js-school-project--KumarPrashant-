# Accessibility Documentation

# Overview
This document is regarding the accessibility improvements made to the Timeline App to ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and provide an inclusive experience for all users, including those who use assistive technologies.

# Accessibility Features Implemented

# 1. Semantic HTML and ARIA Roles

# Modal Dialog
- **Changed**: Replaced `div` modal with semantic `<dialog>` element
- **USES**: Native `<dialog>` provides built-in accessibility features including focus management and screen reader support
- **Implementation**: Added `role="dialog"`, `aria-labelledby`, and `aria-describedby` attributes

# Timeline Navigation
- **Added**: `role="tablist"` to timeline container
- **Added**: `role="tab"` to timeline markers with proper ARIA states
- **Added**: `role="tabpanel"` to event cards
- **USES**: It provides semantic meaning for screen readers and establishes proper navigation patterns

# Current State Indication
- **Added**: `aria-current="true"` to active timeline marker
- **Added**: `aria-selected="true"` for active tab state
- **USES**: It clearly indicates the currently selected item to assistive technologies

# 2. Focus Management

# Modal Focus Trapping
- **Implementation**: Custom focus trap that cycles through focusable elements within modal
- **Features**:
  - Focus moves to modal when opened
  - Tab cycles through modal elements only
  - Shift+Tab works in reverse
  - Focus returns to triggering element when closed

# Keyboard Navigation
- **Timeline Navigation**:
  - `Tab` moves between timeline markers
  - `Arrow keys` (Left/Right) navigate between events
  - `Home/End` jump to first/last event
  - `Enter/Space` activates selected marker
- **Modal Navigation**:
  - `Escape` closes modal
  - `Tab` cycles through modal controls

# 3. Color Contrast and Visual Design

# WCAG AA Compliance
- **Text Color Ratios**:
  - Light theme: 4.57:1 (passes AA)
  - Dark theme: 4.89:1 (passes AA)
- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Primary buttons: 4.52:1
  - Secondary text: 4.61:1
- **Focus Indicators**:
  - High contrast outline (2px solid)
  - Visible on all interactive elements

# High Contrast Mode Support
- **CSS Media Query**: `@media (prefers-contrast: high)`
- **Enhanced Borders**: Stronger border colors for better visibility
- **Focus States**: More prominent focus indicators

# 4. Motion and Animation

# Reduced Motion Support
- **CSS Media Query**: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`
- **Implementation**: Disables all animations and transitions for users who prefer reduced motion
- **Scope**: Affects transitions, keyframe animations and transform animations

#### Respectful Animations
- **Duration**: Kept under 0.5 seconds
- **Purpose**: Only functional animations (state changes)
- **No Auto-play**: No automatically playing content

# 5. Screen Reader Support

# Meaningful Labels
- **Timeline Markers**: Descriptive `aria-label` with event title and year
- **Modal Elements**: Proper labeling with `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby`
- **Interactive Elements**: All buttons and links have accessible names

# 6. Error Handling and Fallbacks

# Image Accessibility
- **Alt Text**: Descriptive alternative text for all images
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when images fail to load
- **Loading States**: Accessible loading indicators

# Graceful Degradation
- Core content remains accessible without JavaScript
- Logical reading order maintained
- Fallback content for failed resources

# Testing Performed

# 1. Manual Testing
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full functionality without mouse
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus flow and trapping
- **Color Contrast**: All text meets WCAG AA standards

# 2. User Testing
- **Motor Impairments**: Large click targets, keyboard alternatives
- **Visual Impairments**: High contrast
- **Cognitive Impairments**: Clear navigation, consistent patterns
